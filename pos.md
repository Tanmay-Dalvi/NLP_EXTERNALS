# Implement POS Tagging

## Title
Implement POS tagging.

## Problem Statement
Understanding the grammatical structure of sentences using Part of Speech (POS) tagging

## Objective
Understand how POS tagging helps in identifying the syntactic structure of sentences

## Theory
Part of Speech (POS) tagging is the fundamental task in natural language processing where each word in sentence is labeled with its corresponding grammatical category. The main parts of speech includes nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions and interjections. POS tagging is essential because it provides syntactic information which is crucial for understanding sentence structure and meaning.

## Approaches to POS Tagging:

### 1. Rule based POS tagging
Rule based systems use handcrafted rules to assign POS tags to words. These rules are often based on morphological, syntactic, and contextual information. Rule based methods are prone to failures in handling unseen or ambiguous cases.

### 2. Statistical POS Tagging
Statistical methods such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) predict the POS tag of a word based on its probability in a given context. These methods leverage large labeled corpora to calculate transition probabilities between tags and the likelihood of a word being assigned a particular tag. Although more flexible than rule-based approaches, statistical methods rely heavily on availability of annotated data.

### 3. Machine learning based POS tagging
Deep learning like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Transformers have become popular for POS tagging. These models automatically learn patterns from large datasets and can handle complex language structures, achieving high accuracy in POS tagging tasks. Libraries like spacy and nltk offer easy-to-use interfaces for such models.

## Applications of POS Tagging:

1. Information Extraction: By identifying key entities and their roles in a sentence, POS tagging aids in extracting important information of unstructured text

2. Sentiment Analysis: POS tagging helps in distinguishing between adjectives (positive, negative words) and nouns, enabling more accurate sentiment analysis

3. Machine Translation: POS tagging ensures that words are translated correctly in the target language by understanding their grammatical roles in source language.

## Code:
```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en-core-web-sm")
text = "Natural language Processing is fascinating."
doc = nlp(text)

for token in doc:
    print(f"{token.text}: {token.pos_}")
```

## Output:
Natural: ADJ (adjective)  
language: PROPN (Proper Noun)  
Processing: PROPN  
is: AUX (Auxiliary Verb)  
fascinating: ADJ (Adjective)  
.: PUNCT (Punctuation)  

## Conclusion
In this experiment, we explored the significance of Part of Speech (POS) tagging as a foundational task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
